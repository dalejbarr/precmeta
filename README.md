# Data and scripts from "Referential precedents in spoken language comprehension"
## Edmundo Kronmüller and Dale J. Barr

This repository contains the scripts and raw data corresponding to the following manuscript:

> Kronmüller, E., & Barr, D. J. (under review).  Referential precedents in spoken language comprehension: A review and meta-analysis.  Manuscript under review.  Draft version, December 31, 2014.  Retrieved from [https://github.com/dalejbarr/precmeta](../master/docs/precmeta_dist.pdf?raw=true).

The current version of the manuscript is [precmeta_dist.pdf](../master/docs/precmeta_dist.pdf?raw=true), and the LaTeX source files are in the [docs](../master/docs) subdirectory.

The raw data are in the subdirectories [Barr2008](../master/Barr2008), [BarrKeysar2002](../master/BarrKeysar2002), [Brown-Schmidt2009](../master/Brown-Schmidt2009) and [KronmullerBarr2007](../master/KronmullerBarr2007). Data from the remaining experiments will be added as permissions are obtained.

The analysis scripts are in [PrecMeta.org](../master/PrecMeta.org), which has R scripts embedded in an [emacs org-mode](http://orgmode.org) document.  The document itself is in plain text and can be opened with any text editor, but is best viewed either through github or in the [emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs) text editor.  The R scripts make heavy use of the [dplyr](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr) and [magrittr](https://github.com/smbache/magrittr) add-on packages for R.
