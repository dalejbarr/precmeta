> Kronmüller, E., & Barr, D. J. (under review).  Referential precedents in spoken language comprehension: A review and meta-analysis.  Manuscript under review.  Draft version, December 31, 2014.  Retrieved from [https://github.com/dalejbarr/precmeta](../master/docs/precmeta_dist.pdf?raw=true).

The current version of the manuscript is [precmeta_dist.pdf](../master/docs/precmeta_dist.pdf?raw=true), and the LaTeX source files are in the [docs](../master/docs) subdirectory.

We reanalyzed data from the 10 experiments below.  The raw data appear in the subdirectories organized by the names of the authors.  Data will be added to the public repository as permissions are obtained.

The analysis scripts are in [PrecMeta.org](../master/PrecMeta.org), which has R scripts embedded in an [emacs org-mode](http://orgmode.org) document.  The document itself is written in a light markup language and can be opened as plain text with any text editor.  It is best viewed either through github or in the [emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs) text editor, which provide syntax highlighting.  The R scripts make heavy use of the [dplyr](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr) and [magrittr](https://github.com/smbache/magrittr) add-on packages for R.
